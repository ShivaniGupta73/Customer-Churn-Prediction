Customer Churn Prediction


The detailed analysis aimed at predicting customer churn in the telecommunication industry focused on a dataset comprising 7043 customers. 
Through exploratory data analysis, significant churn predictors such as offer type, payment method, and contract length were identified. 
The study evaluated three machine learning models: Random Forest, which exhibited the highest accuracy, Logistic Regression, noted for its precision, and K Nearest Neighbors. 

Logistic Regression was chosen for its balance of precision and interpretability. The report also discusses deployment strategies and suggests enhancements like oversampling for improved model performance.

The Applied Machine Learning Final Report investigates telecommunication customer churn, revealing a Logistic Regression model's ROC AUC of 86.9% and an impressive F1 score of 91.1%, indicating its effectiveness in churn prediction. 
The precision of this model makes it a strategic choice for identifying customers at risk of churn, facilitating proactive retention measures.
